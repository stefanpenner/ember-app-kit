# Ember App Kit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit)
Ember App Kit is a foundation for your ambitious web applications built in Ember. It's intended to be used either on its own or as the base scaffolding for generators built on for Ember applications, including [Ember Tools](https://github.com/rpflorence/ember-tools), [generator-ember](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-ember), and a hypothetical official executable at some point in the future.

For usage information, please see the [getting started guide](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit/wiki/Getting-Started).

## Features

- (relatively) Sane project structure
- ES6 module transpiler support (easy, future-proof modules)
- Module system-aware resolver
- Simple ember-testing example
- Testing via QUnit, Ember Testing, and Karma
- Linting source via JSHint (including module syntax)
- Project compilation & minification for easy deploys
- Optional CoffeeScript, SASS, and LESS support
- Optional support for package management via [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower)

## Future goals

- Source maps for transpiled modules
- Better support for usage in generators

Think anything else is missing? Feel free to open an issue (or, even better, a PR)! Discussion and feedback is always appreciated.


## Special Thanks

Some ideas in ember-app-kit originated in work by Yapp Labs (@yapplabs) with McGraw-Hill Education Labs (@mhelabs)
on [yapplabs/glazier](https://github.com/yapplabs/glazier).
Thanks to Yapp and MHE for supporting the Ember ecosystem!
