When using Ember App Kit its important to keep in mind that the Resolver changes some of the naming conventions you would typically use out of the box with Ember, Ember Data and Handlebars. In this section we review some of these naming conventions.

### Views and Templates

Let's say we were using Ember out of the box with the following view:

{% highlight sh %}
App.UserView = Ember.View.extend({});
{% endhighlight %}

We could easily embed this view into a container/parent using the Handlebars view helper:

{% highlight sh %}
{% raw %}
{{ view App.UserView }}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This is great. However, Ember App Kit cusotmizes the default Ember Resolver to help alleviate the issue of namespacing your objects (views, controllers, models, etc.) manually. The above example, as such, will not work in an EAK project.

In EAK our view would be declared like so:

{% highlight sh %}
var UserView = Ember.View.extend({});

export default UserView;
{% endhighlight %}

We can then embed our view using the following convention:

{% highlight sh %}
{% raw %}
{{view 'user'}}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

> Please note that we did not namespace UserView. The resolver takes care of this for you. For more information about the default Ember resolver, check out the source [here](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/blob/master/packages/ember-application/lib/system/resolver.js).

### Filenames

It is important to keep in mind that the Resolver uses filenames to create the associations correctly. This helps you by not having to namespace everything yourself. But there a couple of things you should know.

#### All filenames should be lowercased

{% highlight sh %}
// models/user.js
var User = Ember.Model.extend(); 

export default User;
{% endhighlight %}

#### Comma seperated file names are recommended

You may want to name your files according to their function, this is easily accomplished:

{% highlight sh %}
// models/user_model.js
var UserModel = Ember.Model.extend(); 

export default User;
{% endhighlight %}


#### Nested directories can be referenced

If you prefer to nest your files to better manage your application, you can easily do so.

{% highlight sh %}
// controller/posts/new.js -> controller:posts/new
var PostsNewController = Ember.Controller.extend();

export default PostsNewController;
{% endhighlight %}

If your filename has an underscore in it, we can reference it using the following technique:

{% highlight sh %}
// controller/posts/comment_thread.js -> controller:posts/comment-thread  
var CommentThreadPostsController = Ember.Controller.extend();

export default CommentThreadPostsController;
{% endhighlight %}
